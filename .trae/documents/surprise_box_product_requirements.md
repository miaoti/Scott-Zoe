## 3. Core Process

**Box Owner Flow:**
1. Owner creates surprise box in settings with prize, task, price, and expiration
2. System schedules random box drop for recipient
3. Owner sees box card on home page with disabled approve button
4. When recipient takes action, approve/reject buttons become active
5. Owner approves or rejects recipient's action
6. If approved, prize is added to history; if rejected, recipient can retry

**Box Recipient Flow:**
1. Recipient receives 5-second countdown notification on home page
2. Box drops with smooth animation from top to bottom
3. Recipient clicks box to open and expand into card view
4. Recipient sees task, countdown timer, and action buttons
5. Recipient clicks "Complete Task" or "Pay with Cash"
6. Status changes to "Waiting for Approval"
7. Upon approval, recipient sees congratulations and claims prize
8. Upon rejection, action buttons reappear for retry

## 5. Business Rules

1. **One Active Box Rule**: Each user can own only one active surprise box at a time
2. **One-to-One Relationship**: Boxes are always created for a specific recipient user
3. **Expiration Handling**: Boxes that expire will automatically re-drop until successfully completed
4. **State Synchronization**: All interactions must be real-time synchronized between owner and recipient
5. **Prize Claiming**: Prizes can only be claimed once and are immediately added to history
6. **Retry Mechanism**: Recipients can retry tasks unlimited times if rejected by owner

## 6. Technical Constraints

1. **Real-time Updates**: System must support WebSocket or polling for live state synchronization
2. **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations across all supported devices
3. **Persistence**: All box states, actions, and history must be persisted in database
4. **Scalability**: System should handle multiple concurrent box drops and interactions
5. **Security**: Prevent manipulation of box states and ensure proper user authorization
6. **Mobile Compatibility**: Touch-friendly interactions and responsive design requirements
