# Debug Plan for Zoe's Prize Recording Issue

## Problem
- User 'zoe' cannot record prizes when claiming them from the wheel
- User 'scott' can record prizes successfully
- Both users use the same frontend code and backend endpoints

## Investigation Steps Completed
1. ✅ Examined WheelPrizeController.java - No user-specific logic found
2. ✅ Examined WheelPrizeService.java - Uses standard authentication context
3. ✅ Examined CustomUserDetailsService.java - Standard user lookup by username
4. ✅ Examined WheelPrize entity - No constraints that would affect specific users
5. ✅ Examined User entity - No user-specific constraints
6. ✅ Added detailed logging to WheelPrizeService.recordPrize method

## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated code with enhanced logging
2. Have Zoe attempt to claim a prize
3. Check Railway logs for detailed error information
4. Compare with Scott's successful prize claiming logs

## Potential Issues to Investigate
1. **Case sensitivity**: Username 'zoe' vs 'Zoe' in database
2. **Authentication token**: Different JWT tokens or authentication state
3. **Database constraints**: Hidden constraints on wheel_prizes table
4. **Transaction issues**: Database transaction rollback for specific user
5. **User permissions**: Different user roles or permissions

## Code Changes Made
- Enhanced logging in WheelPrizeService.recordPrize() method
- Added detailed exception logging with exception type and message
- Added step-by-step logging for debugging the prize recording process

## Expected Log Output
When Zoe claims a prize, we should see:
```
Starting prize recording process...
Current authenticated username: zoe
Found user: zoe with ID: [user_id]
Created WheelPrize object: [object_details]
Successfully saved prize with ID: [prize_id] for user: zoe
```

If there's an error, we'll see the exception type and detailed message.
